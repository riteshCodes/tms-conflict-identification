<!--  ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Delays are common occurrences when operating a railway network. Due to the complicated nature of many railway networks and their associated timetables, a single disturbance can start a ripple effect that can spread throughout the entire network. Thus, it is important to deal with the disturbances and restrain any problems. The **Institute of Railway Engineering** at TU Darmstadt focuses on researching questions of daily railway operations and the handling of their disruptions. Here, research for new approaches and algorithms is simulated in the **Eisenbahnbetriebsfeld Darmstadt** (EBD), which is a model railway covering about 500m<sup>2</sup>. <br>
The institute aims to make better use of the existing capacity in the railway network. The focus herein lies with the **Traffic Management System** (TMS), a Proof of concept (PoC), that aims to control and monitor train movements and adapt all train schedules in real times.
TMS suggests respective travelling paths of trains via the "smart logic", a software layer that ensures safety by blocking certain switches in the train path
that could result in collisions. These train journeys are scheduled and executed within the context of the track layout respective to the model railway present in the EBD. Likewise, the executed train journeys are monitored to identify any deviations from the scheduled operations and any conflicts between the scheduled train journeys, which is the goal of **Conflict Identification** module. The schedules of the train journeys affected by the identified deviations should then be dynamically adjusted. Our main client is the EBD but since the EBD is a joint venture between the Akademischer Arbeitskreis Schienenverkehr e.V. (Bahn)" the "DB Training, Learning Consulting" and the "Institut für Bahnsysteme und Bahntechnik der Technischen Universität Darmstadt" the gained knowledge might also be used in other train related projects. We hope that the TMS can show us new ways to reduce train delays and improve services in everyday railway operations.
